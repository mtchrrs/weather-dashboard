# Using the Application

Application URL: https://mtchrrs.github.io/weather-dashboard/

So you're looking for the weather hey? No windows? Don't worry, I've got your back.

When you open up the apllication, you will be presented with the following page
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110107834/191723385-cd040df8-4898-4e8e-9dfb-d498ad480b92.png)

Up the top of the app you can see the time and date. 
To search for a city, you need to type the name into the input ("Search for your city here") and then click the search bar..
For example.. if you searched up 'Perth' the following page would show up...

This screen shows a couple of changes, the first is the creation of the new button, title 'PERTH' under the recent searches section

This will be referenced to later...

The next change that you can see is the title of PERTH, the date and the weather statistics and icon. This shows the current weather statistics for the selected city, as well as what to expect if you were to look outside (icon)

If you scroll down the application, you will see the forecast for the next 5 days, showing the same data as the current days card does above.

Now say that you want to change the location! Simply follow the same process as before, and search for a new city! For example, Brisbane..

Now we can see how the top buttons work...

Say that you wanted to go back and see Perths weather, instead of retyping it, simply click on the button!
